Puzzle4:
An evil king has 1000 bottles of wine. A neighboring queen plots to kill the bad king, and sends a
servant to poison the wine. The king's guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle.
The guards don't know which bottle was poisoned, but they do know that the poison is so potent that
even if it was diluted 1,000,000 times, it would still be fatal. Furthermore, the effects of the poison
take one month to surface. The king decides he will get some of his prisoners in his vast dungeons to
drink the wine. Rather than using 1000 prisoners each assigned to a particular bottle, this king
knows that he needs to murder no more than 10 prisoners to figure out what bottle is poisoned, and
will still be able to drink the rest of the wine in 5 weeks time. How does he pull this off?
